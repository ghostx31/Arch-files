This script was made by me for my friends who are new to Arch Linux. This installs some important tools to get them started on Arch Linux.
  1. paru - The AUR helper 
  2. bat - A clone of cat written in Rust
  3. Checks if system is installed on a BTRFS partition and then installs timeshift and timeshift-autosnap
  4. Adds pacman hooks to /etc/pacman.d/hooks. These are the hooks I use myself in my Arch setup.
  5. linux-zen kernel 
  6. auto-cpufreq tlp and tlpui 
  7. nvidia-dkms drivers
  8. Pulseeffects equaliser.
  9. Pacman-contrib
  10. neofetch - To show off that cute Arch logo lol 
After all these installations, the script updates the system.
